## Statement
In an era where AI governs data, robots are becoming our co-workers, and space is the new frontier, my mission in cybersecurity is not just to protect, but to pave the way for innovation. I aim to secure space assets and missions while advancing next-generation security protocols and technologies for the future of space exploration. I work to ensure that as we push what is technologically possible, we stay grounded in what is technologically secure.

### Featured Publications and Media
I am featured on the cover of the Autumn 2025 issue of ROOM Space Journal of Asgardia, a prominent international publication for space industry and policy leaders.  
My special report inside, “Cyber safety in Earth orbit,” analyzes risks associated with AI-driven spacecraft and ground systems, from adversarial attacks to the possibility of hostile control.
